Find the output for the program. 
 #include<iostream>
 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  int b = 5;
  int sum = -( -a-b );
  cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
The output of the program will be 10.

Explanation:
The expression -a-b evaluates to -10 because the subtraction operator has higher precedence than the unary negation operator. Then the outer unary negation operator - changes the sign of the result to positive, so -(-10) evaluates to 10.

The value of sum is assigned to 10 and it is printed using the cout statement. Therefore, the output of the program is 10.
