Find the output
#include<iostream>
 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   int n = 4;
   n = n >> 2;
   cout << n;
   return 0;
}
The output of the program will be 1.

Explanation:
The program initializes an integer variable n with the value 4. The next line n = n >> 2 shifts the bits of n two positions to the right. The resulting value of n is 1, which is obtained by shifting the bits of 4 two positions to the right.

The cout statement outputs the value of n, which is 1, to the console. Therefore, the output of the program is 1.
